# Arabic-ALBERT Base

Arabic edition of ALBERT Base pretrained language model

## Pretraining data

The models were pretrained on ~4.4 Billion words:

- Arabic version of [OSCAR](https://oscar-corpus.com/) (unshuffled version of the corpus) - filtered from [Common Crawl](http://commoncrawl.org/)
- Recent dump of Arabic [Wikipedia](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html)

__Notes on training data:__

- Our final version of corpus contains some non-Arabic words inlines, which we did not remove from sentences since that would affect some tasks like NER.
- Although non-Arabic characters were lowered as a preprocessing step, since Arabic characters do not have upper or lower case, there is no cased and uncased version of the model.
- The corpus and vocabulary set are not restricted to Modern Standard Arabic, they contain some dialectical Arabic too.

## Pretraining details

- These models were trained using Google ALBERT's github [repository](https://github.com/google-research/albert) on a single TPU v3-8 provided for free from [TFRC](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfrc).
- Our pretraining procedure follows training settings of bert with some changes: trained for 7M training steps with batchsize of 64, instead of 125K with batchsize of 4096.

## How to use

You can use these models by installing `torch` or `tensorflow` and Huggingface library `transformers`. And you can use it directly by initializing it like this:  

```python

from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

# loading the tokenizer
base_tokenizer    = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("kuisailab/albert-base-arabic")

# loading the model
base_model   = AutoModel.from_pretrained("kuisailab/albert-base-arabic")

```
