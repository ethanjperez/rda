# ComVE-gpt2

## Model description

Finetuned model on Commonsense Validation and Explanation (ComVE) dataset introduced in [SemEval2020 Task4](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/21080) using a causal language modeling (CLM) objective.
The model is able to generate a reason why a given natural language statement is against commonsense.

## Intended uses & limitations

You can use the raw model for text generation to generate reasons why natural language statements are against commonsense.

#### How to use

You can use this model directly to generate reasons why the given statement is against commonsense using [`generate.sh`](https://github.com/AliOsm/SemEval2020-Task4-ComVE/tree/master/TaskC-Generation) script.

*Note:* make sure that you are using version `2.4.1` of `transformers` package. Newer versions has some issue in text generation and the model repeats the last token generated again and again.

#### Limitations and bias

The model biased to negate the entered sentence usually instead of producing a factual reason.

## Training data

The model is initialized from the [gpt2](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/model_cards/gpt2-README.md) model and finetuned using [ComVE](https://github.com/wangcunxiang/SemEval2020-Task4-Commonsense-Validation-and-Explanation) dataset which contains 10K against commonsense sentences, each of them is paired with three reference reasons.

## Training procedure

Each natural language statement that against commonsense is concatenated with its reference reason with `<|continue|>` as a separator, then the model finetuned using CLM objective.
The model trained on Nvidia Tesla P100 GPU from Google Colab platform with 5e-5 learning rate, 5 epochs, 128 maximum sequence length and 64 batch size.
