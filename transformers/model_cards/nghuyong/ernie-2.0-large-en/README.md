# ERNIE-2.0-large

## Introduction

ERNIE 2.0 is a continual pre-training framework proposed by Baidu in 2019, 
which builds and learns incrementally pre-training tasks through constant multi-task learning. 
Experimental results demonstrate that ERNIE 2.0 outperforms BERT and XLNet on 16 tasks including English tasks on GLUE benchmarks and several common tasks in Chinese.

This released pytorch model is converted from the officially released PaddlePaddle ERNIE model and 
a series of experiments have been conducted to check the accuracy of the conversion.
