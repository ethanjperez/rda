## T5 for question-generation
This is [t5-small](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683) model trained for answer aware question generation task. The answer text is prepended before the context text. 

You can play with the model using the inference API, just get the input text in this format and see the results!
`answer: answer_text context: context_text </s>`

For example

`answer: 42  context: 42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything. </s>`

nlp("42 is the answer to life, universe and everything.")
=> [{'answer': '42', 'question': 'What is the answer to life, universe and everything?'}]
