## T5 for multi-task QA and QG
This is multi-task [t5-base](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683) model trained for question answering and answer aware question generation tasks. 

For question generation the answer spans are highlighted within the text with special highlight tokens (`<hl>`) and prefixed with 'generate question: '. For QA the input is processed like this `question: question_text context: context_text </s>` 

You can play with the model using the inference API. Here's how you can use it

For QG

`generate question: <hl> 42 <hl> is the answer to life, the universe and everything. </s>`

For QA

`question: What is 42 context: 42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything. </s>`

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/patil-suraj/question_generation/blob/master/question_generation.ipynb)

```python3
from pipelines import pipeline
nlp = pipeline("multitask-qa-qg", model="valhalla/t5-base-qa-qg-hl")

# to generate questions simply pass the text
nlp("42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything.")
=> [{'answer': '42', 'question': 'What is the answer to life, the universe and everything?'}]

# for qa pass a dict with "question" and "context"
nlp({
    "question": "What is 42 ?",
    "context": "42 is the answer to life, the universe and everything."
})
=> 'the answer to life, the universe and everything'
```
