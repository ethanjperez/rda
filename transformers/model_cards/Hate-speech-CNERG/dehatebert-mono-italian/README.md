This model is used detecting **hatespeech** in **Italian language**. The mono in the name refers to the monolingual setting, where the model is trained using only English language data. It is finetuned on multilingual bert model.
The model is trained with different learning rates and the best validation score achieved is 0.837288 for a learning rate of 3e-5. Training code can be found at this [url](https://github.com/punyajoy/DE-LIMIT)
