## RuDR-BERT

RuDR-BERT - Multilingual, Cased, which pretrained on the raw part of the RuDReC corpus (1.4M reviews). Pre-training was based on the [original BERT code](https://github.com/google-research/bert) provided by Google. In particular, Multi-BERT was for used for initialization; vocabulary of Russian subtokens and parameters are the same as in Multi-BERT. Training details are described in our paper. \
