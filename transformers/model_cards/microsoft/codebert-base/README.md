## CodeBERT-base
Pretrained weights for [CodeBERT: A Pre-Trained Model for Programming and Natural Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08155).

### Training Data
The model is trained on bi-modal data (documents & code) of [CodeSearchNet](https://github.com/github/CodeSearchNet)

### Training Objective
This model is initialized with Roberta-base and trained with MLM+RTD objective (cf. the paper).

### Usage
Please see [the official repository](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeBERT) for scripts that support "code search" and "code-to-document generation".
